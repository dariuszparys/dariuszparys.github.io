The number twenty is a special one for me today. Exactly on December 1st, 2000 I joined Microsoft. So it is time for me to
get sentimental and hook up some old habits I did in the past. I had once a blog, started on http://blogs.gotdotnet.com, became very
active during the beginnings and ended in nirvana a couple of years ago. I migrated the archive to Medium (no cross link, why should I)
just to realize how much it sucks. So I just `rm -rf` everything and good.

Enough of old memories, just starting this pile of notes.
